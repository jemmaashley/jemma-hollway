            <p><strong>This is a style guide for a website I wish to make. This is what I've been taught is example text. It's not much more interesting than lorem ipsum, but I thought it might look like I'd put more work if I tried to string together a few real words.</strong></p>
            
            <p>Actually, the more you look at words the more they look less like words. What do any of these letters even mean? The fact that Harper Lee's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_Kill_a_Mockingbird"target="new">'To Kill a Mockingbird'</a> was written using the same 26 little symbols as this piece of shit is so proposterous that it's almost magical. I guess writing is a little bit like floristry... ironic really, considering floristy is exactly what my high-school English teacher threatened me with if I didn't learn to keep my head down and stop trying to be funny.</p>
                
                <p>Sometimes when I finish writing something it feels like I've put together a puzzle, and no matter how much strife it took me to get there that feeling almost makes it all worth it in the end. If I practise enough I think one day I might learn how to arrange my letters in just the right way to change the world (or at least somebody's). </p>

                        <p><strong>Broccoli is my favourite vegetable. They remind me of lots of little trees.</strong></p>
    
                        <p>The best part about having lots of little trees is that you never have to leave the house. As long as you have a bowl full of broccoli you can be anywhere in the world.<a href="https://www.cntraveller.com/gallery/most-beautiful-places-in-the-world" target="new"> Here's where I imagine myself.</a></p>
