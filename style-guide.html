            <p><strong>This is a style guide for a website I wish to make. This is what I've been taught is example text. It's not much more interesting than lorem ipsum, but I thought it might look like I'd put more work if I tried to string together a few real words.</strong></p>
            
            <p>Actually, the more you look at words the more they look less like words. What do any of these letters even mean? The fact that Harper Lee's <strong>'To Kill a Mockingbird'</strong> was written using the same 26 little symbols as this piece of shit is so proposterous that it's almost magical. I guess writing is a little bit like floristry, which is ironic as floristy is exactly what my high-school English teacher threatened me with if I didn't learn to keep my head down and stop trying to be funny.</p>
                
                <p>Sometimes when I finish writing something it feels like I've put together a puzzle, and no matter how much strife it took me to get there that feeling almost makes it all worth it in the end. If I practise enough I think one day I might learn how to arrange my letters in just the right way to change the world (or at least somebody's). </p>
