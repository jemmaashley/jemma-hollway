            <h1>Out & Up.</h1>

            <p>I’m moving out this week.

                <p>Looking around now it’s hard to feel like I ever really lived here at all. Sure, there’s signs of me in the place— the big white rectangles on the front bedroom wall or the broccoli plants in the back garden bed (shrivelled from the sun yet still stretched out towards it, like pruny little hands) and of course in the space by the door where my shoes are sat waiting for my 6pm start, for me to put them on and never come back. My bags are all packed in the car. I used to feel like a piece of the furniture here, now there isn’t any left. Fitting, isn’t it?</p>

                <p>I’m a big girl now. When I’d first moved to Collingwood to start my Digital Media course I’d been fresh faced and absolutely smitten with the idea of life in the big smoke. Don’t get me wrong, I still dream of the day when I can kick my shoes off in the hallway of an Oxford Street apartment and open up a copy of Frankie Magazine to see my name grace the tail end of a freshly printed byline. I’ll bring the paper to my face and inhale, 21 years of angst and anguish and a hint of cinnamon from where it’s at some point collided with my Laurent breakfast in a biodegradable beeswax shopping bag. 
                </p>

                <p>No, my lust for life still very much exists, but I’m weathered now, slightly more realistic, tough around the edges and softer in the middle— like salami, or how I imagine Ben O’Hara might act at Christmas parties. I know now that beeswax wrap is a capitalist scam. I’m allergic to gluten. And print media is about as dead as I’d be if Ben O’Hara ever read this. Last week my long-going Frankie Subscription ended, and to commemorate I accidentally dribbled red wine all over my collection as I re-read the notes I’d highlighted as a fifteen year old (‘pigeon-esque’, I must have liked, because for some reason I’d circled it about a million times in pink sparkly pen. Next to it, a handwritten scrawl; “Use this one day. Very funny.”)
                </p>

                <p>Building my portfolio was just as hard as it was nostalgic. Sifting through things that I’d written two years ago made me realise that I’ve actually come a lot further than I initially thought. Michael Dwyer must have yelled at me 600 times for poor grammar in 2018, this year I caught myself muttering the same phrases under my breath as I struck, asterisked and red-penned my way through other writer's pieces for my internship. That shows progress doesn’t it? The knots in my back would say so.
                </p>

                <p>Being honest, I just think I’ve worked myself to the bloody bone recently. Maybe I do it because I’m scared of failure, or hungry for validation or possibly because I like the idea of having some sort of silent chip on my shoulder— an excuse for staring at my laptop for three hours without writing even so much as a sentence. I find it embarrassingly hard to concentrate most of the time, I have big ideas that sometimes look technicolored and then print out grey when I try and publish them, I don’t have enough time, I have too much time, I’m exhausted. I get scared that if I make something real, and it’s the best I can do, that I’ll have nothing to hide behind anymore. Creatively naked, you could say. Although I would assume most people might choose a different phrasing. ‘Pigeon-esque’ could be a nicer way to put it. 
                </p>

                <p>But like I said, I’m moving out and moving up.</p>

                <p>There are lots of things I would change about the way I’ve done the past couple of years, but I guess the thing I’m learning about growing up is that hindsight has the capacity to hurt just as much as it has to heal. It’s truly the end of a chapter, and now, as I sit cross legged on the floor eating the same brand of two minute noodles I had on this morning exactly two years ago, I’m overwhelmed with the same feeling I got moving here and starting this course in the first place. What the fuck am I doing? What the fuck am I going to do now?
                </p>

                <p>I’m starting to think that perhaps I’ll just feel like this forever. I don’t really mind anymore.
                    You helped me see that everyone else probably does too. 
                    </p>

                    <p>So stay in touch Rikki, I’m going to do some great things very soon. 
                    </p>

                    <p>Thanks for believing in me,
                        Jemma.
                        </p>
